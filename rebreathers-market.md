<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rebreathers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed Circuit Rebreathers</li><li>Semi-Closed Rebreathers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The rebreather market is primarily categorized into two types: closed circuit rebreathers (CCRs) and semi-closed rebreathers (SCRs). CCRs recycle exhaled gas, removing carbon dioxide and replenishing oxygen, allowing for extended dives with minimal gas loss. They are favored in professional diving and military applications for their efficiency and depth capabilities. SCRs, on the other hand, lose some gas to the environment while recirculating the remainder, making them simpler and more user-friendly, ideal for recreational diving and training scenarios.</p></p>
