<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tire</li><li>Bias Tire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The aircraft tire market primarily consists of radial and bias tires. Radial tires feature layers of cords running perpendicular to the direction of travel, offering better fuel efficiency, longer lifespan, and improved heat dissipation, making them ideal for modern, high-performance aircraft. Bias tires, with crisscrossed cord layers, are more durable and cost-effective, suitable for smaller or older aircraft operating in rugged conditions. Both types are designed to withstand extreme loads and stresses, ensuring safety and reliability during takeoff, landing, and taxiing.</p></p>
