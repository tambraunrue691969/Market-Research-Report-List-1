<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polyester Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Saturated Polyesters</li><li>Unsaturated Polyesters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The polyester market is divided into saturated and unsaturated polyesters. Saturated polyesters are thermoplastic polymers with no reactive double bonds, making them stable and durable. They are widely used in coatings, adhesives, and fibers due to their resistance to chemicals and UV light. Unsaturated polyesters, on the other hand, contain reactive double bonds, enabling them to form cross-linked structures when cured. They are primarily used in composites, laminates, and construction materials, offering high strength and versatility. Both types cater to diverse industrial applications.</p></p>
